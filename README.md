# Chat SDK Firebase File Storage 4.1.7

## Why It's Created Here?
[As Bintray is expired](https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/), the 4.1.7 version of [Chat SDK](https://chatsdk.co/) is no longer available to be downloaded through Gradle in the Fairway project. The support team of Chat SDK strongly recommended me to host it in [JitPack](https://jitpack.io). The opensource org is the only way to create a public repo in Big Fish Games. So, here it is...

## Caution!
- This is open source, but it is not created or owned by Big Fish Games.
- The downloaded pom file via Gradle has a different information. Please refer the pom file in this git repo if you need the right information.
